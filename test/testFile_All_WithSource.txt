2135 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet. http://t.co/MthXQ232Hn
2136 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside.. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet. http://t.co/MthXQ232Hn

2172 comment @thatjohn @Holbornlolz Mayday is a call for urgent assistance. (M'aidez). Not a lot of help for a plane hurtling towards the floor. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2173 query @thatjohn @planefinder why would they say urgence in lieu of mayday which is standard ? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2174 comment @thatjohn @gerrylynch mayday is French! 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2175 comment @cobaltjacket @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Lots of radio protocol is French... Mayday is M'aidez. Urgence, pan-pan, "see-lonce" etc. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2176 comment @Fedupwithclowns @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Roger. Just seems odd given most comms are in English. Doesn't make it wrong, of course. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2177 query @thatjohn is that unusual? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2178 comment @cobaltjacket @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Just historic. Also hard to confuse with other words, so clear for the listener. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2179 support @thatjohn @RAeSTimR Is that roughly equivalent to our 'Pan Pan' call it priority I assume? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2180 comment @1CParsons @thatjohn No 'Pan Pan' call is universal 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2181 comment @RAeSTimR @thatjohn Ahh.. I was always taught it was a UK only thing; and having done only limited flying abroad never tested that! 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called ¬´urgence, urgence¬ª (‚Äúemergency, emergency‚Äù), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2182 comment @AirSmolik Only entered FL380 for a few mins prior too. So sad. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2183 comment @AirSmolik but at a controlled speed (unless readings were out), which makes it even more bizarre. I hope they find the real answers soon #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2184 comment @AirSmolik descent rate is not that unusual. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2185 support @AirSmolik Im thinking structurql failure - qnd then depressure etc cockpit window etc ? Trqgique #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2186 support @AirSmolik And apperently no turn to avoid terrain. Straight ahead into the mountains. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2187 comment @AirSmolik pilots may have been suffering a Hypoxie #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2188 comment @AirSmolik @abundare78 would point to a cabin depressurisation #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2189 support @AirSmolik my thoughts exactly. rate is not unusual but surely crew were aware of where they were &amp; terrain... this'll be interesting. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2190 comment @AirSmolik EMERG DESC, set FL68, started descent and lost consciousness before able to set higher ALT? Seems likely... #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
