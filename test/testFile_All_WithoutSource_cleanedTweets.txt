2118 query any idea why it'd flight so high? It's a short flight, usually planes go at ~ 33,000 feet
2119 query But no emergency call made? Or emergency squawk?
2120 comment #A320 #4U9525 initially climbed to 38k ft before starting to descend and lost signal at 6.8k ft
2121 comment Sounds like a decent of 2900fpm
2122 query Any ATC available? Strange.....
2123 query isn‚Äôt 38,000ft unusually high?
2124 comment Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk
2125 comment yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker
2126 comment Only takes a second to set the squawk code,
2127 query What's the use when you're crashing?
2128 comment yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone.....
2129 comment It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now.
2130 comment Unless they became rapidly unconcious
2131 comment It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground.
2132 comment Anyway. Have to wait and see now.
2133 comment For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before
2134 comment No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that.
2135 comment If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant.
2136 comment which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside..
2137 comment Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.
2138 comment What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground
2139 comment They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down.
2140 comment Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set.
2141 comment I don't think the autopilot was engaged.
2142 comment They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane.
2143 comment That's what they say.
2144 comment The data from the transponder made it obvious.
2145 comment Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though.
2146 deny The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700.
2147 comment It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no
2148 comment distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did
2149 comment crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up.
2150 comment It only takes a moment to enter 7700 into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before.
2151 comment Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says)
2152 support The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up.
2153 comment Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made
2154 comment the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them
2155 comment and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck.
2156 comment Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved.
2157 comment But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged.
2158 comment what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged?
2159 comment It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.
2160 comment Lets wait for NTSB to tell us why it happened. I hope its not terrorism.
2161 comment difficult times for the families involved what a loss
2162 support A tragedy for the families and friends of the plane travelers and workers! Despite news, may at least some of them could survive?

2165 comment :thank you for putting me on the TB list.
2166 comment Hope we will not to hear this kind of news once again!
2167 comment So sad to know that it was a deliberate suicide
2168 query how many 'nazis' did leebowitz kill ?
2169 comment A White European terrorist did a white wing suicide terrorist attack
2170 query what are the implications of this?
2171 comment They made that call in French?
2172 comment Mayday is a call for urgent assistance. (M'aidez). Not a lot of help for a plane hurtling towards the floor.
2173 query why would they say urgence in lieu of mayday which is standard ?
2174 comment mayday is French!
2175 comment Lots of radio protocol is French... Mayday is M'aidez. Urgence, pan-pan, "see-lonce" etc.
2176 comment Roger. Just seems odd given most comms are in English. Doesn't make it wrong, of course.
2177 query is that unusual?
2178 comment Just historic. Also hard to confuse with other words, so clear for the listener.
2179 support Is that roughly equivalent to our 'Pan Pan' call it priority I assume?
2180 comment No 'Pan Pan' call is universal
2181 comment Ahh.. I was always taught it was a UK only thing; and having done only limited flying abroad never tested that!
2182 comment Only entered FL380 for a few mins prior too. So sad.
2183 comment but at a controlled speed (unless readings were out), which makes it even more bizarre. I hope they find the real answers soon
2184 comment descent rate is not that unusual.
2185 support Im thinking structurql failure - qnd then depressure etc cockpit window etc ? Trqgique
2186 support And apperently no turn to avoid terrain. Straight ahead into the mountains.
2187 comment pilots may have been suffering a Hypoxie
2188 comment would point to a cabin depressurisation
2189 support my thoughts exactly. rate is not unusual but surely crew were aware of where they were &amp; terrain... this'll be interesting.
2190 comment EMERG DESC, set FL68, started descent and lost consciousness before able to set higher ALT? Seems likely...

2218 deny Signalled 911? Called 'Mayday' would be more appropriate, factual reporting...
2219 query signaled 911?
2220 query . What does that even mean? Why would European pilots say 911 - an American emergency phone number? Nothing in article about that.
2221 comment you might want to change the use of 911 in this context.
