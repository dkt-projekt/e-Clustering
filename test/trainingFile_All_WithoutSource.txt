1214 comment @asoldiersvoice @DanteB4u @num1_fan how convenient for this police chief....he needs to just go
1215 support .@mmwlawtaos @KatEdmiston - Spin still doesn't justify the murder versus the arrest. Why did the #Ferguson officer not call for backup?
1216 query @DanteB4u Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question 2nd suspect?
1217 comment @DanteB4u @Alasscan_ Racist LIE to make it seem like innocent black child was a criminal. It will not work!! Police LIE may start more riots
1218 comment @orangeseahorse IF Brown committed strong arm robbery is one thing,but cop response is still another entirely. No riots. Justice  @DanteB4u
1219 comment @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ - Even if not innocent, no justification for violating rights, removing due process &amp; execution #Ferguson MURDER!
1220 comment @Alasscan_ @DanteB4u It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk.
1221 comment @DanteB4u Absolutely my point!!  @orangeseahorse
1222 comment @DanteB4u @KatEdmiston There's no spin, cops blew it from day one by not releasing shooter's name! Trying to control the narrative w/liesüëéüö´.
1223 comment @orangeseahorse There are pics of "strong arm robbery" clothing description/size of assailant similar BUT cop deadly force? No! @DanteB4u
1224 support @DanteB4u You're right! Police said fight started after cop told Michael to get out of street, walk on sidewalk! He was never a suspect!
1225 support @Alasscan_ @DanteB4u Alasscan it's a lie. Pics are fake. No robbery was reported! If true, police would have said it last week to stop riots
1226 comment .@mmwlawtaos @KatEdmiston - #Ferguson PD tried to justify probable cause, even 1st &amp; 2d shot, everything after = premeditated murder.
1227 comment @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_   He is innocent of any death penalty offense. Even if assault is involved.
1228 comment @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_  The problem is that some police and others believe in a concept of a Free Kill.
1229 comment .@orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ - Even if robbery took place &amp; stop legal, actions after 1st &amp; 2d shot &amp; after #MikeBrown put #HandsUp = MURDER
1230 query @DorothyKidd1 Absolutely!  @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse
1231 comment @orangeseahorse Sadly #DorianJohnson friend of #MichaelBrown was in store also &amp; has admitted to it @DanteB4u @Alasscan_
1232 comment @DanteB4u IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived @orangeseahorse
1233 comment @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_   Where there is just enough justification that a person thinks they can get by with it.
1234 comment @DanteB4u Besides a person who committed a robbery wouldn't call attention to himself by walking in the middle of the street. It's a lie.
1235 comment @DorothyKidd1 @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_  - #Ferguson cop administered "Street Justice." Execution for alleged robbery, No go!
1236 comment @DanteB4u Sov. Citizen in Dallas this week PLANNED TO KILL COPS and was brought in alive, how come a Shoplifter is denied same courtesy?
1237 comment @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_  It doesn't matter if you are police, gang, or neighborhood watch. Life means more.
1238 comment @DanteB4u @CallsForJustice Never mentioned "robbery" in his confrontation with them...where is the corresponding dispatch call?
1239 comment @DanteB4u @KatEdmiston Probable cause for what? The alleged robbery that cop wasn't aware of (so it appears) or alleged assault of cop?
1240 comment .@mmwlawtaos @KatEdmiston - #Ferguson PD new story is trying to establish: probable cause, justify 1st &amp; 2d shot, but can't justify extras.
1241 comment @DanteB4u theve acted the same even over a bag of chips
1242 comment @DanteB4u @DarkMission1 Why did it take 5 days for this "info" to come out? Looks like #Ferguson PD is looking for excuses for murder.

1249 comment @coreybking @DanteB4u @CallsForJustice @FergusonPolice time to arrest D Wilson, guys.  Sorry, but shooting ppl u think are thieves isn't OK.
1250 comment .@coreybking @nyblossom @CallsForJustice - No narrative will justify actions after the 2d shot, #MikeBrown surrendered, cop kept firing @CNN
1251 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ Robbers do not just stroll down the middle of the street after robbing a store. @CNN IDIOTS #Ferguson
1252 comment @DanteB4u @nyblossom @CallsForJustice @CNN and that's cold blooded murder!
1253 comment @mmwlawtaos @DanteB4u @KatEdmiston There is a very fishy fishing expedition going on in #Ferguson looking for excuses for murder.
1254 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ Someone needs to explain how the cop shot #MichaelBrown &amp; then NEVER called an ambulance?
1255 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ The let him die so he could not talk. Police station learned of shooting from the news not Wilson
1256 comment .@bucci2028 @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_  - Wilson knew he intentionally killed an alleged suspect trying to surrender to him &amp; people saw it.
1257 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ I know : (  but sicker part is we don't know if Michael was dead or the let him die so he couldn't talk
1258 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ Michael never received emergency medical treatment, they left him in the street &amp; labeled the event
1259 comment @DanteB4u @orangeseahorse @Alasscan_ a riot not a robbery suspect apprehended.

1432 comment @mashable  if there was a black person in an altercation in a convenience store, that totally justifies killing another black person, right?
1433 comment @drpolson @TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable A black cop shot Mr. Brown if he is charged (it will be racist) there will be more riots.
1434 comment @zadiaz @TracyMo53321503 @mashable Wait, so why didn't we shoot down the ARMED (white) men who shot up theaters and schools?
1435 comment @itsmeggroll @zadiaz @mashable They killed themselves, Thugs are thugs whatever color they are.
1436 comment @mashable poor baby "he din do nuffin" lol

1443 comment @zadiaz @mashable no I'm sure the violent felon put his hands right up and the evil policeman after 6 yrs of service decided to kill 4 fun!
1444 comment @Copscantweet2 are you afraid of admitting you're a racist? Are you afraid of being called a racist?
1445 comment @zadiaz race doesn't matter to me nor should it matter to this case. You are the racist. Facts don't matter 2u Just blindly follow the herd.

1447 comment @Copscantweet2 you do a lot of bitching and whining, but never make any points.
1448 support @Copscantweet2 yep this picture proves he wasn't on his knees with his hands up. And the Mr Wilson didn't empty his gun on him. Nice work.
1449 comment @TheAnonMessage2 Yeah. @donlemon just did on CNN.
1450 support @TheAnonMessage2 had the same flip flops on.
1451 comment It's a good thing u went to detective school....wat would the cops do w/o u? @TheAnonMessage2
1452 support @TheAnonMessage2 yes hat and sandals vs no hat and tennis shoes
1453 support .@TheAnonMessage2  yes. They don't match. Flip flops + hat in store. Shoes + no hat in final pic.
1454 support @Manning_Eli_1 @TheAnonMessage2  I thought the same thing.
1455 deny @TheAnonMessage2 http://t.co/nyf2SaMMh8
1456 support @TheAnonMessage2 no, because that would require reasoning and then if reasoning is applied, no one can be shot. Shoot now, reason later.
1457 comment @RemarkablyDope @TheAnonMessage2 is it me, or the dude in the security cam photos is bald? Mike Brown isn't bald i dont belive
1458 comment @EricsSauces @TheAnonMessage2 it's not him lmao the store owners already said so
1459 comment @RemarkablyDope @TheAnonMessage2 my God @stlcountypd sucks
1460 comment Identical but irrelevant RT @TheAnonMessage2: Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing to the security footage?
1461 support @TheAnonMessage2 Did anyone think that, holy balls, he was old enough to know how to change his clothes?
1462 deny @YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The property would have been valued by store employee not cops. Retail cost as determined by business.
1463 comment @YourAnonLive Could've been a 60 count box which are ~$40. Box like this: http://t.co/HnBy8k86GG
1464 comment @YourAnonLive Actually it's pretty reasonable. Maybe do research before tweeting to the masses? http://t.co/gFeDyb1RrY
1465 comment @YourAnonLive You should be focusing on the ROBBERY charge and not the SHOPLIFTING charge.
1466 comment @YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The key here is the verbiage Theft,burglary,larceny, or Robbery? Robbery is the term in this report!
1467 support @nickk330 @YourAnonLive If he stole a case of cigars, where were they?
1468 comment @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson that's also not a robbery in most jurisdictions, it's a petty theft. (Eg Los Angeles)
1469 query @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson no signatures?
1470 comment @DeuceTony @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson I bet they just typed that up this morning.
1471 comment @DeuceTony @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson they're not finished yet, didn't want to sign rough draft.
1472 comment @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson So there are already two different charges!\nhttps://t.co/73iKLAlP3U\nAnd none of them shows Michael Browns name!!!
1473 comment @YourAnonLive @JayTheQuad it also says they didn't arrive on the scene for the first time until 8/13

1482 comment @freewebcamporn @YourAnonLive man. in so heated over this
1483 comment @YourAnonLive @FrancoisKilljoy for real.. I buy a box for 15 bucks.
1484 comment @InfectiousChris lmap research before tweeting? pfft if anything this entire mess had showed research is the last thing people use
1485 comment @agentbell4272 @YourAnonLive why robbery..whats the difference between shoplift or robbery..I have not read report yet
1486 support @PancakeBreasts Anon has been pretty awful through this whole thing.
1487 comment @InfectiousChris I meant in general. People went off the deep end and believed the 1st thing they heard or read. No matter how 1 sided
1488 support @PancakeBreasts Oh for sure.. Anon has been exceptionally awful though!
1489 comment @bonedog84 @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive I stole gum from a drugstore as a kid. Glad Im alive to tell it.
1490 comment @YourAnonLive I think perhaps they‚Äôre saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display‚Ä¶as opposed to one package.
1491 comment @iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive they have the whole thing on video..
1492 comment @GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @YourAnonLive you have a link? or you just taking their word for it?
1493 comment @JillJhorvath  Robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property
1494 comment @iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive it was on the news where I live.
1495 query @GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @nickk330 ok, have you seen the video?
1496 query @agentbell4272 right.  So he did that for cigars ? I know I need to sit and read report.   What's your thoughts on sll this
1497 query @YourAnonLive @euIVmusic WHY does the time stamp say 11:51 on the report, but one of the stills of the robbery shows 11:53?
1498 deny @NBCNews @JDBmsnbc  That guy is much fatter then Michael and older
1499 comment @NBCNews Is there a police report we can see? Initially, the police said the victim was stopped for walking in the street.  #Ferguson

1503 deny @NBCNews Now they say this? Not very believable.
1504 query @NBCNews Easy to know if this is Brown by looking at what he was wearing when he was killed.  Has there been a positive ID for this?

1507 comment @SplatsReads @NBCNews one sure way to know would be if they tested for DNA on the employees shirt...
1508 comment .@NBCNews why are the cops releasing this? Has nothing to do with later shooting.

1510 comment @RockRt66 @NBCNews True.  However if clothes were different or the same would do it also - I doubt that he the time to change.
1511 comment @RockRt66 @NBCNews Even so - since when do you shoot a suspected robber if he is unarmed and cooperating?
1512 comment @SplatsReads @NBCNews I agree it isn't robbery its simple shoplifting an assult
1513 comment . @NBCNews Which excuses him getting shot in the street and his body left there for four hours HOW? Y'all are magpies; all you see is shiny.
1514 comment @NBCNews It doesn't matter if it's him in this picture or not the report said he was unarmed still no reason to shoot him #Ferguson
1515 support @NBCNews  that is him same hat and outfit at sceen still gave no right to kill him

1520 comment .@jashsf @JesseLaGreca I've been in #Ferguson Market and it looks exactly like where the alleged robber was standing.
1521 query @JustinGlawe @JesseLaGreca thanks. Now we need a pic of what michael brown was wearing to refute the video.
1522 comment @140elect just think how this story would be if the cop was black and the vic was white
1523 comment @140elect exactly. if the criminal commits strong-arm robbery but has no weapon when he grasps for the officers he should be let go.
1524 comment @140elect compare the pix... store dude in flip-flops. Mike Brown- pix look like running shoes? (need better pix of Mike Brown in street)

1529 comment @140elect @TrendingBlue If only they had the balls to say "We're sorry"
1530 comment @140elect @AnonymousPress It sounds similar to what the Egyptian police did to Khalid Saeid in 2011!
1531 comment @140elect @Upsilon_Ab It's almost like the local cops are pissed it was so calm last night and want to inflame public opinion again
1532 comment .@140elect @AkaDimiX "Kid".  He was just a harmless little baby, just got out of kindergarten...
1533 comment .@ArthurAndrews5 @140elect You wouldn't have heard shit about it.
1534 comment @140elect Fox News will talk about it now
1535 comment @140elect Or, for all we know, it's standard practice.
1536 comment @DostoevskyShade @140elect 18 is young in absolute terms, an adult legally speaking.  But why pick that out of all that to respond to?
1537 comment @DostoevskyShade @140elect like me mistakenly calling an 18 year old a kid is worse than the other 4 points?
1538 deny .@AkaDimiX @140elect B/c that's the obvious lie. Everything else theoretically could've happened. But 6'4, 290 pound man is no "kid".
1539 comment @AkaDimiX @140elect It is.  I'm calling out this shit media every time now.  I had the reaction everyone did when they saw Trayvon's pic.
1540 deny @AkaDimiX @140elect I was like, WTF, you could just wring a little kids neck, no need for a gun.  Until we find out the guy is frigging 6'2
1541 comment @DostoevskyShade @140elect 17 is a minor, 18's an adult.  Being big has no relevance.
1542 comment @AkaDimiX @140elect Yeah, tell that to the 300 pound 6'4 dude who confronts you versus a 140 pound 5'2 30 yr old.
1543 support @DostoevskyShade @140elect trayvon was 17 when he got killed.  Legally a minor.
1544 comment @AkaDimiX @140elect It's abt being fearful something bad could happen to you. A little kid is not reasonable fear. A dude taller than u, yes
1545 comment @DostoevskyShade all eyewitnesses we've heard from say the cop dragged MB towards his car through his window.  The cop initiated.
1546 comment @DostoevskyShade call him a big ass kid then.  But size or being "intimidating" doesn't take away your youth, inexperience, kid status
1547 comment @AkaDimiX Yes, let's have an investigation. But you think someone can drag that guy anywhere, let alone a window?  Nah.
1548 deny @AkaDimiX My grandfather enlisted in WWII when he was 17.  That's not a kid, despite the sissification of this nation.
1549 support @DostoevskyShade legally speaking , yeah he was.
1550 deny @AkaDimiX legally speaking it doesn't matter. the question of reasonable fear is at issue + the krauts were definitely afraid of my grandpa.

1565 comment @PrisonPlanet NOTHING justifies militarized police pointing sniper rifles at anyone #fixed
1566 comment @PrisonPlanet or pointing any weapon at any non-combatant

1570 support @PrisonPlanet @dollaranarch what about drone killing innocent bystanders that are near an alleged bad guy? We turn cheek No Twitter outrage

1575 comment @PrisonPlanet there was shots fired from in the riot nite 1.I heard it live on the police scanner.I think theyre worried about armed rioters

1578 comment @PrisonPlanet MINOR LOOTING? LOL
1579 deny @PrisonPlanet new bill Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement act drafted yesterday http://t.co/LSMWErCzbE
1580 support @PrisonPlanet I say even before journalists, CITIZENS! but now the journalists can put light on the situation, it's all across the U.S.
1581 comment .@PrisonPlanet Is that why you guys posted TONS of photos of looters on the first day this story broke? You're so much like the MSM you hate
1582 comment @flavius217 At least they are thorough.  @GenXMedia
1583 support @flavius217 @rui_xu How? They are giving info that the media asked for.
1584 comment @jlpauk @flavius217 They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting
1585 comment @rui_xu @jlpauk also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.
1586 comment @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!
1587 comment @spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.
1588 query @spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
1589 comment @rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
1590 comment @rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
1591 query @flavius217 @rui_xu Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?
1592 comment @flavius217 I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?
1593 comment @dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question.
1594 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
1595 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times.
1596 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have
1597 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses.
1598 query @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
1599 comment @spants @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu P MUCH
1600 comment @flavius217 And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.
1601 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That's two different arguments.
1602 comment @dissuade it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
1603 support @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
1604 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
1605 support @flavius217 Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.
1606 support @flavius217 @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.
1607 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .
1608 comment @flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
1609 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
1610 deny @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.
1611 query @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
1612 comment @dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.
1613 query @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting?
1614 comment @flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
1615 comment @dissuade strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
1616 support @flavius217 Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.
1617 comment @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.
1618 comment @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.
1619 comment @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things.
1620 support @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.
1621 comment @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.
1622 deny @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police
1623 comment @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.
1624 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.
1625 deny @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.
1626 support @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds
1627 query @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.
1628 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.
1629 query @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?
1630 comment @Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 LOL
1631 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.
1632 comment @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.
1633 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
1634 comment @flavius217 this turned out to be a very popular tweet
1635 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
1636 support @FortClank it sure did. A boon to my #brand
1637 comment @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
1638 query @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
1639 query @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?
1640 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul, yesterday:  "Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this
1641 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 country is just not paying close enough attention."
1642 query @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
1643 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.
1644 support @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.
1645 deny @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.
1646 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.
1647 comment @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.
1648 query @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet?
1649 deny @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.
1650 deny @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away
1651 comment @Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.
1652 deny @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.
1653 comment @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?
1654 comment @jlpauk @spants per chief belmar: "a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."
1655 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF
1656 comment @jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
1657 query @Tom_sveb @flavius217 I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
1658 deny @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
1659 comment @spants @flavius217 ok
1660 support @Tom_sveb @spants And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?
1661 comment @jlpauk why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?
1662 comment @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.
1663 comment @jlpauk there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
1664 query @jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
1665 support @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?
1666 comment @Tom_sveb An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
1667 deny @jlpauk @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants UNSUBSCRIBE

1878 comment @thelittleidiot not even if he IS stealing.
1879 comment @thelittleidiot no but it shows this person's character and his disregard for the law and law enforcement this fact is highly relevant here.
1880 comment @thelittleidiot Yes but it does warrant being shot to death by the store owner. Its called Karma.  Guy has a rap sheet as long as your arm
1881 comment @thelittleidiot  @rollyberry So what?  The police still have to work within the confines of the law even if others do not.
1882 support @thelittleidiot Thanks for clearing that up. I was really confused about that. ;-)
1883 comment @thelittleidiot you would be blown away by the swedish police then‚Ä¶
1884 support @thelittleidiot agreed. Being shot for possibly stealing cigars isn't karma, it's excessive force that doesn't match the crime.

1888 support @thelittleidiot Speak to them Moby, tell em!!!

1907 query @rolandsmartin initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation
1908 query @rolandsmartin may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him
1909 comment @rolandsmartin It's a conniving way to do a smear campaign. Darren Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer. #JusticeForMikeBrown #Ferguson
1910 support @rolandsmartin Because jaywalking and stealing cigars are capital crimes. It's the classic "Blame the victim" defense.
1911 comment @rolandsmartin SUSPICION of a crime results n DEATH of the unarmed in the #Black comm as a rule. #MichaelBrown #EricGarner #TrayvonMartin
1912 deny @rolandsmartin &lt;&lt;he didn't know at all they still has a B.O.L.O out at 7 for the suspect
1913 comment @rolandsmartin wasn't it just this morning they were saying it was the reason
1914 comment @rolandsmartin I'm not sure there was a "robbery". Convenience stores keep tobacco behind a counter where you PAY first! IJS #MikeBrown
1915 deny @rolandsmartin their account is getting worse and worse Roland
1916 comment @Jurutha if u watch the tape, he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
1917 comment @sachibub10 you can't tell whether there was somebody behind the counter or not. Either way not related to shooting.
1918 comment @Jurutha I hear ya, but u said the swishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie
1919 query @rolandsmartin they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he "prime suspect" just minutes after?
1920 support @rolandsmartin when that didn't made logical sense, now it was jaywalking? And he felt the nd to use deadly force for jaywalking? Lol
1921 deny Well, yeah.  He had to trash the name of a dead child before providing that little tid bit. @rolandsmartin
1922 deny @rolandsmartin ok so that was mike in the convenience store?
1923 comment @WSJ that's big
1924 comment @WSJ Mike thought the coppers were on to him so he tried to assault the officer to get away. #shame..
1925 comment @WSJ #HandsUpDontShoot hashtavists still don't know his hands were up.
1926 support @WSJ This, and their militaristic approach to the problem, does not paint the Fergie PD in a favorable light
1927 deny @WSJ This point is irrelevant.  What is important is what happened after the officer contacted the suspect.
1928 deny @WSJ I believe the robbery actually did happen and is not alleged.
1929 support @WSJ @tabster_1 So he thought he will pick on this black kid because it was a slow day?
1930 comment @ThiruNagan @WSJ no justification needed...
1931 comment @tabster_1 @WSJ I asked the guy at the airport. Why did you chose me for a search? He said it was random. I did not buy that.

1935 comment @WSJ and Brown wasn't aware that the cop was unaware of the violent robbery Brown had just committed.
1936 comment @WSJ I am sure Cops go to work thinking what black kid can I shoot today and cause riots and Al Sharpton to speak again ..SMH
1937 comment @WSJ NOTE TO SELF: Actions of committing amy crime, no matter how misqal may justify my death to some, regardless to how unwarranted.
1938 support @WSJ How is robbery define by state law? Where are the reports from the shooting? Why no ambulance? #ferguson #foi
1939 deny @WSJ i don't believe that is what he said. He said the stop was initially not about that. Previously, they said he knew of robbery and...
1940 deny @WSJ had a description.
1941 comment @LoraineLawson @WSJ Go Back To Sleep Loraine!!!
1942 query @tipofthemitt @WSJ You thought of that all by yourself??? Amazingly Irrelevant!!!
1943 deny @TPM @McBlondeLand Awful! The DOJ needs to do thorough investigation of this PD-these problems are systemic. The citizens deserve better!

1948 comment @TPM @AzmatZahra Just plain scary.
1949 comment @TPM @AzmatZahra Wouldn't you have thought after widely publicized abuses by LAPD and CPD, that departments everywhere else would learn??
1950 comment @LisaBloom @ZerlinaMaxwell For that reason precisely, media should refrain from connecting the two. Stay with the shooting story.
1951 comment @LisaBloom that's unfortunate. signed, ferguson PD
1952 query It's a strategy to manipulate media and misinform people. @LisaBloom
1953 comment @LisaBloom you know the cop didnt have to know about robbery for this video to have value. you're not very good at being stupid.
1954 comment @LisaBloom @lawalazu  it's about changing the narrative.
1955 query @LisaBloom Lisa is he the confirmed robber?
1956 support @LisaBloom @southerntalker #Ferguson Chief needs to be removed from his job...I never meant 4 this 2 happen..don't insult our intelligence
1957 deny @LisaBloom Polluting potential jurors by any Chief of LEOs should be an intentional malice reprimand,+ the county DA may be his Advisor
1958 comment @RobKCorbettEsq @LisaBloom And it is down right disrespectful to the young man and his family.
1959 comment @LisaBloom #MikeBrown connects the robbery w shooting. dont have to be a genius. a guy who shoves clerk is s'posed to raise his hands later?
1960 comment @LisaBloom  stranger by the second
1961 comment @LisaBloom Have to show Mike without clean hands somehow.

1963 query @leonlohr @LisaBloom Shoving a clerk means you'll take on a police officer with a  gun? #SoundLogic #YesThisIsSarcasm #MikeBrown
1964 comment @LisaBloom I want to believe its total incompetence.  But its was all on purpose to change public opinion.  My guess is it will continue
1965 support @LisaBloom that's what I thought too... http://t.co/SALT2ztcEq
1966 query @LisaBloom did of release the report filed by Wilson?
1967 comment @LisaBloom he didn't say he didn't know about the robbery, it went out over radio, he said he didn't know #MikeBrown was a suspect
1968 comment @veggietrunks @leonlohr @LisaBloom it prevented future crimes by #MikeBrown
1969 deny @LisaBloom but mike brown knew about the robbery and DIDN'T know the cop didn't know - that's what makes it POSSIBLY relevant
1970 comment @LisaBloom @ZerlinaMaxwell The people responsible for killing #MikeBrown should not be in control of the evidence proving what happenend.
1971 query @LisaBloom Did the media ask for the video under FOIA as the Chief of Police said? And why was video released without  commentary in am?
1972 comment @veggietrunks @LisaBloom not necessarily. but it might show a particular disposition towards authority figures.
1973 comment @LisaBloom Of course he did. It gave people time to solidify the opinions that they already had. It was a calculated move.
1974 support @LisaBloom the chief said this am that cop was at a call for sick person, then got the call for store strong arm robbery
1975 support @TimWiseheart Incorrect. Was on sick person call &amp; then driving came across Brown &amp; friend walking &amp; asked they get off the road @LisaBloom
1976 comment @29plussome @LisaBloom i relistened to the press conf &amp; ur right i was wrong
1977 support @29plussome @LisaBloom seems like theres soo much about this case it gets confusing yet there isnt enough info??
1978 comment @TimWiseheart It's like the 'connect the dots' books. If they sold cliff notes, they'd be outdated by day end. Bumbling idiots @LisaBloom
1979 query @leonlohr @LisaBloom But she's very good at instigating and baiting....just like her mother. Smh
1980 query @leonlohr @LisaBloom and who would blame them when those authority figures are gunning surrendering suspects down?
1981 support @leonlohr @LisaBloom I rolled through a stop sign once, the cop was shouting at me like I killed someone. I was terrified. They #overreact.
1982 comment @missypach @LisaBloom i had no idea that was her mom.
1983 comment @veggietrunks @LisaBloom since the 'witness' version is incomplete/inaccurate the whole 'hands up' part prob isn't true either #Ferguson
1984 comment @veggietrunks @LisaBloom sad that happened to you. no doubt there are racist/ignorant cops. but not all, maybe not #Ferguson
1985 query @leonlohr @LisaBloom Yep!! Splitting image in everything except one has black hair and other blonde....
1986 comment @andybankertv @FOX2now no doubt scared for his life. It's obviously mike brown in the video
1987 comment @andybankertv @FOX2now Somebody else probably did commit theft.  Brown committed Robbery.
1988 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot? http://t.co/O8mE7LTuoc
1989 comment @a_man_in_black @andybankertv @FOX2now dude even his parents acknowledge it's him.
1990 query @andybankertv @FOX2now Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
1991 query @andybankertv @FOX2now   Is that the video also?
1992 query @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter?
1993 comment @JohnGerads @FOX2now actually I did use the word robbery
1994 comment @tomman191 @FOX2now he seemed frightened
1995 comment @lilfer1234 @FOX2now possibly. He seemed frightened
1996 query @andybankertv @DavidSTLhss @FOX2now even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft?
1997 comment @andybankertv @FOX2now Your post states theft.  What am I missing?
1998 query @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place?
1999 comment @a_man_in_black @andybankertv @FOX2now Dorian Johnson just confirmed it was them. What now? #blackdenial
2000 comment @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior?
2001 comment @SLEEZAVELLI @andybankertv @FOX2now I def did not say that. And even if it was #mikesmith I certainly don't think he deserved to die for it.
2002 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change
2003 comment @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now im not saying you did, but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation
2004 comment @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said
2005 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him
2006 comment @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends
2007 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him
2008 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him)
2009 deny @SLEEZAVELLI @andybankertv @FOX2now Not by this kid.

2012 comment @andybankertv @FOX2now Brown's family attorney said in an interview today that the person in the video "probably is Brown"
2013 comment @lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice.
2014 support @SLEEZAVELLI @andybankertv @FOX2now Truer words have never been spoken.
2015 comment @a_man_in_black @andybankertv @FOX2now it's obviously the same people and there's a confession
2016 comment @JohnGerads @FOX2now when I spoke to store owner, I said "robbery", tweeted "theft" in error
2017 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now Hey everybody, @tomman1 robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down?
2018 query @lilfer1234 @SLEEZAVELLI @andybankertv @FOX2now whose mike smith ?

2021 comment @a_man_in_black @andybankertv @FOX2now @tomman1 And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
2022 comment @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now Then what are you arguing?
2023 query @tomman191 @andybankertv @FOX2now So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol

2036 comment @andybankertv  now we now why!!  Jeez!!

2039 comment @jelani9 I would rather be a #robber than being a #ColdBloodedMurderer #JusticeForMikeBrown Nowüò°
2040 comment @jelani9 @kharyp Since they want to label #MikeBrown as a shoplifter, since when is that crime punishable by DEATH?
2041 comment @jelani9 @kharyp I bet if Michael Brown had his druthers, he‚Äôd rather have his name dragged thru the mud than his life snuffed out.
2042 support @jelani9 SAY IT AGAIN!!!! oh nevermind, I can just RT it ;-)
2043 comment damn surveillance video @jelani9 We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud. @LOLGOP
2044 comment @jelani9 People may not like it. but it's devastating for prosecuting the cop. If true, can be argued Brown thought the cop was after him .
2045 comment @jelani9 Prosecution screwed up the Martin/Zimmerman case by over-charging and if emotions guide, over charging will let this cop walk too.
2046 comment @jelani9 The first goal is to get a conviction so he can never be a cop again.
2047 comment Not sure 'shoot first &amp; uncover potential crime later' is viable policy outside the fevered mind of a conservative @ecl326 @jelani9 @kharyp
2048 comment @techweenie @jelani9 @kharyp AMEN to that!! They would say "LOOK! HE PUSHED THAT STORE CLERK!!.. is that punishable by DEATH?
2049 comment @techweenie @ecl326 @jelani9 @kharyp Early reports said the store had not reported a robbery?? The people in the store don't look alarmed.
2050 comment @amstillion @techweenie @jelani9 @kharyp From what I saw it was nothing but a petty theft. Let the RT Wing tell it, he went in with a GLOCK
2051 comment The point is, the cop didn't know about a robbery. He executed a jaywalker resisting being detained @amstillion @ecl326 @jelani9 @kharyp
2052 comment @techweenie @amstillion @jelani9 @kharyp EXACTLY!! Since when is jaywalking punishable by DEATH?
2053 support @TheDailyEdge can find him either under a white cone hat or a koch bed!

2331 comment @cholmes96 I was there before the police were
2332 comment @Henderburn so.. Instead of helping you took a picture for profit?
2333 comment @tdgecas yeah posting information about an evolving shooter situation is less worthwhile than an untrained journalist performing CPR
2334 deny @tdgecas Fuck you idiot
2335 comment @Henderburn don't have to give cpr. Other ways to help. But yeah keep looking for profit. Great professionalism.
2336 comment @Henderburn stay safe. Hope you're never in the same situation.

2346 comment @tdgecas @Henderburn so yeah, expecting to get paid for doing his job seems pretty professional to me
2347 deny @BigDilbertFan photography is his job? My whole issue was a man needed help. There are ways to help if you don't know cpr
2348 comment @tdgecas @henderburn I didn't realize you were on the scene and could verify that he could have saved the life of the guy shot four times.
2349 query @tdgecas @Henderburn Getting the word out about an active shooter situation seems pretty helpful, but please, tell us what you'd have done.
2350 comment @BigDilbertFan Call 911? Signal for help? Keep an eye out for the rescuers? Simply ask the people if there's anything he can do?
2351 deny @BigDilbertFan we won't agree on this and that's okay. If you're in Ottawa stay safe.
2352 comment @tdgecas You don't have any evidence that he didn't do any of these things in addition to taking a picture, but you accuse away.
2353 comment @tdgecas Way to care for people.
2354 comment @tdgecas @Henderburn I agree Tyler, have some respect.That man shot is servicing your country and all you want to do is snap a pic.Pity you!

2356 deny @Henderburn I have no issue with warning people whatsoever. But to take a photo, please!
2357 deny @DriesBrent the photo does not show the soldier. It shows the response. Brave bystanders trying to save him
2358 comment @DriesBrent @tdgecas @Henderburn You have a phone! Did you call for help? Nope. I took pics to sell and tweeted that I'm on CNN and ABC.

2524 deny @subloke @kellyoxford @obiterdictayo Stated as fact before news outlets even suggested.Still uncertain.Leave news to news pros.Done here.
2525 deny @subloke @HDMcC @kellyoxford @obiterdictayo they confirm facts before 'reporting'.
2526 comment @HDMcC maybe people shouldn't look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts?

2531 comment @HDMcC @subloke I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
2532 deny @kellyoxford @HDMcC maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
2533 support @HDMcC @kellyoxford exactly, because they are "journalists" and "dems the rules" Kelly is a "comedic writer" no rules. Go police journalists
2534 support @daxshepard1 @HDMcC THANK YOU.

2912 comment @JRMarlow @darrellbricker @SeanOsmar That may be harsh.  He seems to be honouring. Just unaware of source.

4110 comment @9NewsSyd @charlescwcooke I hope I'm wrong, but sounded like 3 shotgun blasts started activity...then automatic weapons fire. 1/2
4111 support @9NewsSyd @charlescwcooke That would mean worst case: scumbag started shooting hostages and police responded. Hope that is not the case. 2/2
4112 comment @9NewsSyd @marilynmaupin Should have snipered him.
4113 support @TexasJew I heard (who knows if it's true) there might be explosives.  Not a good time to shot.
4114 support @TexasJew Aside from that, yeah.
4115 query @marilynmaupin This peaceful resolution shit just resulted in dead and wounded hostages
4116 query @TexasJew Again, so far as I can tell, they were worried about explosives, and it appears there was an explosion.
4117 comment @TexasJew My only issue with shooting him in the head was that it's too quick of a death.
4118 comment @marilynmaupin That was probably a flash-boom from police
