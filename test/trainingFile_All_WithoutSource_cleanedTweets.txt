1202 comment More like  why was #DarrenWilson trying to pull #MikeBrown into police car thru the window?
1203 comment . - Barney Fife would have tried to pull #MikeBrown through a window too. Shades of Ernest T. Bass #Ferguson
1204 comment A good question. I still think the cop was on drugs and hallucinating.
1205 comment Agreed, Dante!
1206 support Agreed-also,if #MikeBrown was suspect,why not just question him? Why tell him &amp; friend get off road,not stop them? #bsDetector
1207 comment And at least Barney Fife would have been HONEST from the first hour.
1208 comment . - The Barney Fife fear is real in #Ferguson, total excessive force is common practice. This was a murder!
1209 comment Agree those Cops in #Ferguson are filled with #FEAR so they hide behind military equipment, outrageous tactics
1210 comment Thank goodness the cops in #Ferguson aren't very bright. Makes it easier to sue their sorry asses!
1211 comment and his bullet would have been harmlessly in his pocket. #Ferguson
1212 comment They had 2 splice some tapes together.
1213 comment The cops can't spin this unlawful shooting try as they may. Police Dept. credibility ruined with Ferguson community.
1214 comment how convenient for this police chief....he needs to just go
1215 support . - Spin still doesn't justify the murder versus the arrest. Why did the #Ferguson officer not call for backup?
1216 query Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question 2nd suspect?
1217 comment Racist LIE to make it seem like innocent black child was a criminal. It will not work!! Police LIE may start more riots
1218 comment IF Brown committed strong arm robbery is one thing,but cop response is still another entirely. No riots. Justice
1219 comment - Even if not innocent, no justification for violating rights, removing due process &amp; execution #Ferguson MURDER!
1220 comment It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk.
1221 comment Absolutely my point!!
1222 comment There's no spin, cops blew it from day one by not releasing shooter's name! Trying to control the narrative w/liesüëéüö´.
1223 comment There are pics of "strong arm robbery" clothing description/size of assailant similar BUT cop deadly force? No!
1224 support You're right! Police said fight started after cop told Michael to get out of street, walk on sidewalk! He was never a suspect!
1225 support Alasscan it's a lie. Pics are fake. No robbery was reported! If true, police would have said it last week to stop riots
1226 comment . - #Ferguson PD tried to justify probable cause, even 1st &amp; 2d shot, everything after = premeditated murder.
1227 comment He is innocent of any death penalty offense. Even if assault is involved.
1228 comment The problem is that some police and others believe in a concept of a Free Kill.
1229 comment . - Even if robbery took place &amp; stop legal, actions after 1st &amp; 2d shot &amp; after #MikeBrown put #HandsUp = MURDER
1230 query Absolutely!
1231 comment Sadly #DorianJohnson friend of #MichaelBrown was in store also &amp; has admitted to it
1232 comment IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived
1233 comment Where there is just enough justification that a person thinks they can get by with it.
1234 comment Besides a person who committed a robbery wouldn't call attention to himself by walking in the middle of the street. It's a lie.
1235 comment - #Ferguson cop administered "Street Justice." Execution for alleged robbery, No go!
1236 comment Sov. Citizen in Dallas this week PLANNED TO KILL COPS and was brought in alive, how come a Shoplifter is denied same courtesy?
1237 comment It doesn't matter if you are police, gang, or neighborhood watch. Life means more.
1238 comment Never mentioned "robbery" in his confrontation with them...where is the corresponding dispatch call?
1239 comment Probable cause for what? The alleged robbery that cop wasn't aware of (so it appears) or alleged assault of cop?
1240 comment . - #Ferguson PD new story is trying to establish: probable cause, justify 1st &amp; 2d shot, but can't justify extras.
1241 comment theve acted the same even over a bag of chips
1242 comment Why did it take 5 days for this "info" to come out? Looks like #Ferguson PD is looking for excuses for murder.
1243 comment Corey, think we're gonna find out DWilson had no idea that MB had stolen Swishers. WAIT4 IT.
1244 comment . -#Ferguson PD trying to make case for probable cause, initial 1st &amp; 2d shot, but can't for execution w/Hands Up
1245 comment Of course not...they have this fake police report, but no dispatch call detailing alleged robbery!
1246 comment Cop never mentions shooting. Dispatch never mentions robbery.
1247 comment get outta d f'in road! (moreover). I'm sorry, time to call for the arrest now, of Mr. Darren Wilson.
1248 comment But they have had six days to come up with a narrative though!
1249 comment time to arrest D Wilson, guys. Sorry, but shooting ppl u think are thieves isn't OK.
1250 comment .  - No narrative will justify actions after the 2d shot, #MikeBrown surrendered, cop kept firing
1251 comment Robbers do not just stroll down the middle of the street after robbing a store. IDIOTS #Ferguson
1252 comment and that's cold blooded murder!
1253 comment There is a very fishy fishing expedition going on in #Ferguson looking for excuses for murder.
1254 comment Someone needs to explain how the cop shot #MichaelBrown &amp; then NEVER called an ambulance?
1255 comment The let him die so he could not talk. Police station learned of shooting from the news not Wilson
1256 comment .  - Wilson knew he intentionally killed an alleged suspect trying to surrender to him &amp; people saw it.
1257 comment I know : ( but sicker part is we don't know if Michael was dead or the let him die so he couldn't talk
1258 comment Michael never received emergency medical treatment, they left him in the street &amp; labeled the event
1259 comment a riot not a robbery suspect apprehended.
1260 comment | We need to see/review the statement by officer Wilson on what happened.
1261 comment It's not about smarts, it's that they never had to justify their actions "Rubber Stamped"
1262 support TYPICAL OF COWARDS AND BULLIES
1263 comment YES!!
1264 comment To think after all this time a lame-assed story about stolen cigars is going to fly is beyond stupid!
1265 comment Affluent people and those in authority take it as an affront to be questioned, especially by lesser people
1266 comment Apparently they don't think people can think for themselves. How WRONG they are. Will live to regret it
1267 comment Yes!
1268 comment AND that attitude will be their downfall too. Bet on it.
1269 comment That makes no sense at all.

1276 comment Dorian's lawyer said in CNN interview Dorian had admitted it as he give his witness statement
1277 comment Dorian admitted from day 1.Now rumor has it that store never called 911 who called? 911 tape?
1278 comment Heard that friend was not going to be "charged" in any robbery since video shows it was other person
1279 query Makes me wonder since robbery report filled out day later. Also was cigarillo value raised?
1280 comment Who is 'other person?' 1st police LIE saying friend confessed. Under pressure, they now say he was not involved
1281 comment 1st interview #politicsnation #DorianJohnson mentions cigarillos &amp; told lawyer. Video shows he gave back, not Mike #Ferguson
1282 comment I say no more #streetjustice/freekill. No matter who does it.
1283 query Max are you listening to what the Chief of Police said or do you just want to believe lies? Listen carefully
1284 comment Don't understand your argument - we're both on same side. Was repeating what Dorian said. Also Chief walked stmt back later
1285 comment Now another store video out that some say shows #MichaelBrown DID pay 4 cigarillos - confusing
1286 comment This shows Michael paid for cigarillos. No robbery, no crime! Pls
1287 comment Thing is Killer cop knew nothing -was just being a ASSHOLE BULLY-started to leave backed up-killed kid

1302 comment you do an amazing job! Thank you.
1303 query - Is it true there was a struggle in the squad car, before shooting?
1304 comment I'm sure they covered up all his disciplinary actions. They've had almost a week to set up a defense strategy!
1305 comment 6 years is a "veteran"? ‚Äú Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.‚Äù

1318 support exactly
1319 comment "strong-armed"? But not actually "armed." Soooo, the use of deadly force against him? How can it be justified?
1320 deny that's bs. there's always a "history" when the African Americans gets killed.

1341 comment "Strong armed" is being used to obfuscate; sounds like the perp was armed, which he wasn't, &amp; the crime was SHOPLIFTING.
1342 comment that's problematic.

1352 deny You are supposed to not be biased when you're a journalist. Glad you can come up with that decision without knowing all the facts
1353 query If they were criminals why did the police not arrest his friend right away?They shot one robber &amp; let the other go #MikeBrown
1354 comment a story that continues to repeat itself, over and over and over in America. #Ferguson
1355 deny no he was walking IN the street big difference
1356 comment oh hell of course
1357 comment that still is no excuse to kill him
1358 comment all I see is him walking in a store
1359 deny LIES! #MikeBrown was not wanted 4 robbery otherise his friend would hv been considered an accomplice...#COVERUP #Ferguson
1360 comment Even if connected, does that mean he should be shot 8 times with his hands up on the ground?
1361 comment I have a real civil rights idea that WILL work.
1362 comment Of course, you have to crop have his face. #Ferguson #MikeBrown
1363 comment #Lies if those kids were involved why would the officer just tell the kids to get on the sidewalk, not get on the ground?
1364 comment he stole a candy bar and was threatened the cops will come to resolve the issue
1365 deny this isn't him clearly
1366 comment this guy is way fatter than mike
1367 query didn't the manager of the store already say this was not true
1368 comment OMG this IS a police state, if this was true,the Nazi #Police wouldve already put this out there they are #GraspingAtStraws
1369 comment I want to know what kind of vision the police have to clearly say this is Mike Brown! I can barely see a face
1370 comment Now I dont even believe they gave the right name of the officer.one lie leads to another and another..they r buried in lies
1371 deny LIES
1372 support omg stfu already. Did you see the clothes the kid was wearing, looked similar. Agree with you but quit fucking fishing.
1373 comment lol there's a million dudes wearing cargos &amp; white tees everyday please stop
1374 comment these pictures look damning, but stealing rillos DOES NOT JUSTIFY MURDER!
1375 comment just so my opinion is clear; no way that kid should be dead, period! Anon ain't the vigilante he thinks
1376 support Video manipulation takes time.  If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself? #Ferguson
1377 comment It's easier to manipulate pictures than a video.
1378 comment why is that even relevant?!
1379 support they did release the video..up to the journalists to post them
1380 deny is that even him in the stills?
1381 deny To not telegraph their court case ‚Äú If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not video itself? #Ferguson‚Äù
1382 comment That's what you got from those looks like some1 pushing an old lady around.... no?
1383 comment maybe they will do like 911 and cut out frames
1384 comment ‚Äú Video manipulation takes time.  If there's surveillance of a robbery why release stills &amp; not video? #Ferguson.‚Äù
1385 support look at the shoes
1386 comment doesn't justify him getting shot several times.
1387 support Because it shows Brown negatively. The real issue is: Why did a cop shoot and kill an unarmed man, hands up?
1388 query Where is the video from the cellphone taken from one of the witnesses who saw Brown shot and killed?
1389 comment got me all wrong the robbery suspect is wearing sandals but michael is wearing tennis shoes- few mins later
1390 support It doesn't matter. The cop shouldn't have killed him. Also, I'd like to see the damn injuries the wussy cop had.
1391 comment Gentle giant.
1392 query is that Mike Brown? the guy in these pics looks a lot bigger than the pics of Mike Brown in prior still photos released?
1393 comment oh well that just justifies everything doesn't it. #HANDSUPdontshoot
1394 deny That person does not look 18. It actually looks a lot like a looter with their face covered that was photographed by
1395 deny check your facts and the pics from what he was wearing when he was gunned down, smh
1396 comment Good folk of Ferguson, Support your Police Dept., Riot against the THUGS in your town.
1397 comment This proves what? Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery
1398 deny Gentle Giant, RIGHT. Go arrest that partner he had too.
1399 comment JUSTICE FOR THE POLICE DEPT. they were doing their job &amp; protecting your sorry butts.
1400 comment Waiting to see an outpouring of sympathy for the owner of the store that was attacked. Not holding my breath.
1401 comment doesn't excuse murder
1402 comment that dude is huge
1403 deny are you really justifying the murder of an unarmed kid? o
1404 query red hat?
1405 comment He wasn't a kid, an Adult who was robbing a business.
1406 comment if the officer did his job he would be arrested not murdered. Still the point.
1407 comment are you justifying the murder of an unarmed ADULT?
1408 comment here goes the fukkry now look at his picture.o wait he is black robber black. Has it been confirmed. Or just blow smoke our bum
1409 support YES, it was JUSTIFIED
1410 query umm wasn't Mike Brown wearing pants, and shoes?
1411 deny you are saying that's mike brown in the picture? It's not. Two events unconnected. What's your point?
1412 comment you're one sick racist bitch
1413 comment You are a Peter Piper follower. Monkey see, monkey do.
1414 comment You're one sick stupid person.
1415 query what point are you making about the photo?
1416 comment If this is real, I feel one of those #aweshit moments coming on both sides, the neighborhood and the police.
1417 deny this is mike brown stop lying and get your facts straight next time you insult another HUMANS life
1418 comment He is large. In the store photos you have some prospective unlike the still photos.
1419 comment Take a look at college football players, roughly same size and maturity (in terms of looking older).
1420 comment my brother played, I'm familiar with their size
1421 comment That maybe he did try &amp; take cops gun though window (something witnesses could not see). This goes toward CHARACTER. üòê
1422 comment i'd be a bad witness
1423 comment Wow!
1424 query I'm looking for his read hat and his flip flops can you find them?
1425 comment I didn't head you üëÇ
1426 comment I think is saying: tough guy in pic is low life scum whether it's the late Mr. Brown or not
1427 comment then what's the relevance?
1428 comment low life scum I think
1429 query still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. But ok.
1430 comment 18 is an ADULT
1431 comment I said teen not child but again, how is the pic relevant?
1432 comment if there was a black person in an altercation in a convenience store, that totally justifies killing another black person, right?
1433 comment A black cop shot Mr. Brown if he is charged (it will be racist) there will be more riots.
1434 comment Wait, so why didn't we shoot down the ARMED (white) men who shot up theaters and schools?
1435 comment They killed themselves, Thugs are thugs whatever color they are.
1436 comment poor baby "he din do nuffin" lol
1437 comment um, they killed themself. #whendumbpeopletweet
1438 query James Holmes is still alive. So is the guy who shot a congresswomen in Az.
1439 comment .
1440 query 
1441 comment Call me "dumb" all you want. Just realize that probably makes your tawdry, feeble-minded ass stupid (at best) in comparison.
1442 comment Aaaaand this:
1443 comment no I'm sure the violent felon put his hands right up and the evil policeman after 6 yrs of service decided to kill 4 fun!
1444 comment are you afraid of admitting you're a racist? Are you afraid of being called a racist?
1445 comment race doesn't matter to me nor should it matter to this case. You are the racist. Facts don't matter 2u Just blindly follow the herd.
1446 comment 
1447 comment you do a lot of bitching and whining, but never make any points.
1448 support yep this picture proves he wasn't on his knees with his hands up. And the Mr Wilson didn't empty his gun on him. Nice work.
1449 comment Yeah. just did on CNN.
1450 support had the same flip flops on.
1451 comment It's a good thing u went to detective school....wat would the cops do w/o u?
1452 support yes hat and sandals vs no hat and tennis shoes
1453 support . yes. They don't match. Flip flops + hat in store. Shoes + no hat in final pic.
1454 support I thought the same thing.
1455 deny 
1456 support no, because that would require reasoning and then if reasoning is applied, no one can be shot. Shoot now, reason later.
1457 comment is it me, or the dude in the security cam photos is bald? Mike Brown isn't bald i dont belive
1458 comment it's not him lmao the store owners already said so
1459 comment my God sucks
1460 comment Identical but irrelevant  Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing to the security footage?
1461 support Did anyone think that, holy balls, he was old enough to know how to change his clothes?
1462 deny The property would have been valued by store employee not cops. Retail cost as determined by business.
1463 comment Could've been a 60 count box which are ~$40. Box like this:
1464 comment Actually it's pretty reasonable. Maybe do research before tweeting to the masses?
1465 comment You should be focusing on the ROBBERY charge and not the SHOPLIFTING charge.
1466 comment The key here is the verbiage Theft,burglary,larceny, or Robbery? Robbery is the term in this report!
1467 support If he stole a case of cigars, where were they?
1468 comment that's also not a robbery in most jurisdictions, it's a petty theft. (Eg Los Angeles)
1469 query no signatures?
1470 comment I bet they just typed that up this morning.
1471 comment they're not finished yet, didn't want to sign rough draft.
1472 comment So there are already two different charges!\n\nAnd none of them shows Michael Browns name!!!
1473 comment it also says they didn't arrive on the scene for the first time until 8/13
1474 comment right. I made better report cards on Photoshop üò≠
1475 support so not even a felony... Haha
1476 comment $50 ?! Shit.. Mane this is some nonsense the report don't even look right. Missing info allat
1477 comment Notice the top this says 2nd suspect. Mike Brown is suspect #1. Please read everything out there.
1478 comment Good look! Thank you!
1479 support You're welcome!
1480 comment if they have the box it would be in evidence, but that's assuming this isn't just fabricated to create an excuse for the cop
1481 comment Items Stolen: 1 - Items Recovered: 0 - Fatally Shot Suspects: 1...
1482 comment man. in so heated over this
1483 comment for real.. I buy a box for 15 bucks.
1484 comment lmap research before tweeting? pfft if anything this entire mess had showed research is the last thing people use
1485 comment why robbery..whats the difference between shoplift or robbery..I have not read report yet
1486 support Anon has been pretty awful through this whole thing.
1487 comment I meant in general. People went off the deep end and believed the 1st thing they heard or read. No matter how 1 sided
1488 support Oh for sure.. Anon has been exceptionally awful though!
1489 comment I stole gum from a drugstore as a kid. Glad Im alive to tell it.
1490 comment I think perhaps they‚Äôre saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display‚Ä¶as opposed to one package.
1491 comment they have the whole thing on video..
1492 comment you have a link? or you just taking their word for it?
1493 comment Robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property
1494 comment it was on the news where I live.
1495 query ok, have you seen the video?
1496 query right. So he did that for cigars ? I know I need to sit and read report.  What's your thoughts on sll this
1497 query WHY does the time stamp say 11:51 on the report, but one of the stills of the robbery shows 11:53?
1498 deny That guy is much fatter then Michael and older
1499 comment Is there a police report we can see? Initially, the police said the victim was stopped for walking in the street. #Ferguson
1500 comment Here's a petition to stop militarization of police departments
1501 comment Is robbery a death penalty in MO? and without a trial?
1502 comment Photos of alleged robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson (via police)
1503 deny Now they say this? Not very believable.
1504 query Easy to know if this is Brown by looking at what he was wearing when he was killed. Has there been a positive ID for this?
1505 comment Photos of alleged robbery involving #MikeBrown in #Ferguson (via police)
1506 comment Now police issue pix of "alleged" robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson  via
1507 comment one sure way to know would be if they tested for DNA on the employees shirt...
1508 comment . why are the cops releasing this? Has nothing to do with later shooting.
1509 comment ‚Äú Photos of alleged robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson (via police)  üòíüòí
1510 comment True. However if clothes were different or the same would do it also - I doubt that he the time to change.
1511 comment Even so - since when do you shoot a suspected robber if he is unarmed and cooperating?
1512 comment I agree it isn't robbery its simple shoplifting an assult
1513 comment . Which excuses him getting shot in the street and his body left there for four hours HOW? Y'all are magpies; all you see is shiny.
1514 comment It doesn't matter if it's him in this picture or not the report said he was unarmed still no reason to shoot him #Ferguson
1515 support that is him same hat and outfit at sceen still gave no right to kill him
1516 comment SIGN AND SHARE #Ferguson #JusticeForMikeBrown
1517 comment Who are you to expect any type of answer in the first place?
1518 comment a person who makes his living asking questions, that's who.
1519 query it wasn't the quik stop that got burned down?
1520 comment . I've been in #Ferguson Market and it looks exactly like where the alleged robber was standing.
1521 query thanks. Now we need a pic of what michael brown was wearing to refute the video.
1522 comment just think how this story would be if the cop was black and the vic was white
1523 comment exactly. if the criminal commits strong-arm robbery but has no weapon when he grasps for the officers he should be let go.
1524 comment compare the pix... store dude in flip-flops. Mike Brown- pix look like running shoes? (need better pix of Mike Brown in street)
1525 comment Here are pixs I have.
1526 comment Police Force or Apartheid? Two thirds of 21,000 residents are black - Police force 3 black &amp; 50 white policemen
1527 comment better camera pic. clearly shows flip flops
1528 deny Said the typical Libtard.
1529 comment If only they had the balls to say "We're sorry"
1530 comment It sounds similar to what the Egyptian police did to Khalid Saeid in 2011!
1531 comment It's almost like the local cops are pissed it was so calm last night and want to inflame public opinion again
1532 comment . "Kid". He was just a harmless little baby, just got out of kindergarten...
1533 comment . You wouldn't have heard shit about it.
1534 comment Fox News will talk about it now
1535 comment Or, for all we know, it's standard practice.
1536 comment 18 is young in absolute terms, an adult legally speaking. But why pick that out of all that to respond to?
1537 comment like me mistakenly calling an 18 year old a kid is worse than the other 4 points?
1538 deny . B/c that's the obvious lie. Everything else theoretically could've happened. But 6'4, 290 pound man is no "kid".
1539 comment It is. I'm calling out this shit media every time now. I had the reaction everyone did when they saw Trayvon's pic.
1540 deny I was like, WTF, you could just wring a little kids neck, no need for a gun. Until we find out the guy is frigging 6'2
1541 comment 17 is a minor, 18's an adult. Being big has no relevance.
1542 comment Yeah, tell that to the 300 pound 6'4 dude who confronts you versus a 140 pound 5'2 30 yr old.
1543 support trayvon was 17 when he got killed. Legally a minor.
1544 comment It's abt being fearful something bad could happen to you. A little kid is not reasonable fear. A dude taller than u, yes
1545 comment all eyewitnesses we've heard from say the cop dragged MB towards his car through his window. The cop initiated.
1546 comment call him a big ass kid then. But size or being "intimidating" doesn't take away your youth, inexperience, kid status
1547 comment Yes, let's have an investigation. But you think someone can drag that guy anywhere, let alone a window? Nah.
1548 deny My grandfather enlisted in WWII when he was 17. That's not a kid, despite the sissification of this nation.
1549 support legally speaking , yeah he was.
1550 deny legally speaking it doesn't matter. the question of reasonable fear is at issue + the krauts were definitely afraid of my grandpa.
1551 comment Shoot unarmed kid.\nConceal evidence.\nImpose martial law.\nHarass reporters.\nSmear the victim.\nWorst. Police. Ever.\n\n| \n#Ferguson MT
1552 deny It's fine if you don't care about this one black kid. But don't you care about due process?!
1553 comment all the reactionaries learned this "strong-arm" phrase today.
1554 comment sure. everyone lies but the "minority" in these situations.
1555 comment try reading comprehension.
1556 comment done. i read "comprehension". now what, genius?
1557 comment .  Why do you start your question with a lie?
1558 comment And they think we're buying this bullshit!
1559 query sorry what now?
1560 deny I'm sorry "kid", I gotz no times for bs. Peace.
1561 comment Why should only cops be allowed to have guns again? #gunsense #UniteBlue
1562 comment I think that's all you got time for.
1563 comment you don't. I also think you're lying abt your entire online identity.
1564 deny u win. \n i'm apparently not qualified for hottie of the week anymore. take it back.
1565 comment NOTHING justifies militarized police pointing sniper rifles at anyone #fixed
1566 comment or pointing any weapon at any non-combatant
1567 comment the original lie is going to screw them, everything after the first day is a separate crime. they didn't care about boston!
1568 comment You misspelled citizens.
1569 comment at anyone!
1570 support what about drone killing innocent bystanders that are near an alleged bad guy? We turn cheek No Twitter outrage
1571 support Not simply a title: Journalists, but CITIZENS, Paul. Everyday USA People/CITIZENS protesting Police MURDER/Subterfuge! --GBJ
1572 query minor looting? Didn't they burn down a store?
1573 comment Journalists, poor and the homeless are not Royalty.
1574 comment except molotov cocktails. Molotov cocktails justify snipers...
1575 comment there was shots fired from in the riot nite 1.I heard it live on the police scanner.I think theyre worried about armed rioters
1576 support oh yea the malatov cocktails too.
1577 comment How about this
1578 comment MINOR LOOTING? LOL
1579 deny new bill Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement act drafted yesterday
1580 support I say even before journalists, CITIZENS! but now the journalists can put light on the situation, it's all across the U.S.
1581 comment . Is that why you guys posted TONS of photos of looters on the first day this story broke? You're so much like the MSM you hate
1582 comment At least they are thorough.
1583 support How? They are giving info that the media asked for.
1584 comment They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting
1585 comment also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.
1586 comment What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!
1587 comment and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.
1588 query to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
1589 comment They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
1590 comment They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
1591 query Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?
1592 comment I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?
1593 comment p sure you know the answer to that question.
1594 comment For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
1595 comment I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times.
1596 comment and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have
1597 comment Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses.
1598 query What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
1599 comment P MUCH
1600 comment And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.
1601 comment That's two different arguments.
1602 comment it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
1603 support they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
1604 comment the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
1605 support Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.
1606 support I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.
1607 comment it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .
1608 comment Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
1609 comment and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
1610 deny What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.
1611 query Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
1612 comment I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.
1613 query an investigative report on the shooting?
1614 comment White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
1615 comment strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
1616 support Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.
1617 comment What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.
1618 comment He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.
1619 comment There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things.
1620 support You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.
1621 comment I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.
1622 deny Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police
1623 comment and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.
1624 comment why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.
1625 deny then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.
1626 support autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds
1627 query That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.
1628 comment that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.
1629 query Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?
1630 comment LOL
1631 comment everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.
1632 comment They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.
1633 comment Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
1634 comment this turned out to be a very popular tweet
1635 comment No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
1636 support it sure did. A boon to my #brand
1637 comment If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
1638 query What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
1639 query in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?
1640 comment Rand Paul, yesterday: "Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this
1641 comment country is just not paying close enough attention."
1642 query If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
1643 comment If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.
1644 support Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.
1645 deny Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.
1646 comment who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.
1647 comment Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.
1648 query Has that info came out yet?
1649 deny You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.
1650 deny confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away
1651 comment Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.
1652 deny Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.
1653 comment do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?
1654 comment per chief belmar: "a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."
1655 comment that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF
1656 comment I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
1657 query I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
1658 deny I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
1659 comment ok
1660 support And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?
1661 comment why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?
1662 comment They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.
1663 comment there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
1664 query dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
1665 support So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?
1666 comment An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
1667 deny UNSUBSCRIBE
1668 comment BAM ANTI-WHITES get caught with their foot in their mouth in front of the WORLD LMAO
1669 comment anti-whites ? #lulz
1670 comment A robbery doesn't excuse an execution style murder I don't give a fuck what anyone says. Swisher Sweets aren't worth a life.
1671 comment don't make this a race issue. The militarization of the police is the issue
1672 deny Good job, faggots. You IDd the wrong man.
1673 comment yup Anti-Racist is a codeword for ANTI-WHITE

1716 comment They're trying to skirt the situation &amp; take focus off of Darren Wilson. Who's left over to blame? Dead victim.
1717 comment Hopefully not - I'm seeing a lot of people who recognize that his involvement in the robbery is irrelevant to his execution

1768 comment People act like he was shot because he was black, but if it was a white kid or a black cop no one would care.
1769 comment there doesnt have to be money stolen/ just stolen itemsto be a robbery, they said it is robbery bc the use of force
1770 query then why accuse him of a robbery if thats not why they killed him? Whats the point of bringing it up..
1771 comment to make him he look like a thug ? üò¥

1773 comment rather he was orange , purple or grey they dead ass wrong ... If it were your relative u would feel different .
1774 comment Yes which from the video, he looks like thug. They are trying to make it seem like he could have done something to the cop
1775 comment It was to show his mentality. To prove that he isn't as innocent as anyone thought he was.

1799 query ‚Äú  what about the FBI‚ÄùüëÄ

1834 deny Wrong. The violent assault #MikeBrown committed makes it more likely he attacked the cops minutes later. #Ferguson
1835 deny no they did not
1836 comment Walking in the street while #Black
1837 support Hmm. That's not what I heard at all. What's your source and quote?
1838 support if he was not a suspect why was #MikeBrown inside the police car in the first place? Or was he ever near the police car?
1839 deny smdh. This is ridiculous.
1840 comment That is probably the whole point of releasing the video. Very sad/devious.
1841 comment We would rather talk about anything other than a white police officer murdering an unarmed black kid. #Ferguson
1842 comment why not wait for the investigation &amp; try your best to be objective.

1848 comment THAT WAS THEIR PLAN &amp; ITS WORKING WITH THE SHEEP!!
1849 support This is exactly what the #Ferguson PD &amp; their PR machine want-focus off their indefensible behavior.
1850 comment Not surprising. #MichaelBrown
1851 support exactly.
1852 comment What's more frustrating even than that is that this is exactly why they did it that way, and everyone is falling for it.

1876 comment A. In a white privilege world
1877 deny She has a valid concern. You offer a grossly exaggerated red herring in order too...?
1878 comment not even if he IS stealing.
1879 comment no but it shows this person's character and his disregard for the law and law enforcement this fact is highly relevant here.
1880 comment Yes but it does warrant being shot to death by the store owner. Its called Karma. Guy has a rap sheet as long as your arm
1881 comment So what? The police still have to work within the confines of the law even if others do not.
1882 support Thanks for clearing that up. I was really confused about that. ;-)
1883 comment you would be blown away by the swedish police then‚Ä¶
1884 support agreed. Being shot for possibly stealing cigars isn't karma, it's excessive force that doesn't match the crime.
1885 deny Hey on top of bein selfadmitted idiot : ) Yer also Retarted LOL #Libs + their #Ferguson #WelfarePet Thugs
1886 deny . a 300lbs aggressive young man might get shot if he attacks a cop.

1905 comment Thats because their SKANKERS
1906 deny SUCH BULLSHIT!!
1907 query initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation
1908 query may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him
1909 comment It's a conniving way to do a smear campaign. Darren Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer. #JusticeForMikeBrown #Ferguson
1910 support Because jaywalking and stealing cigars are capital crimes. It's the classic "Blame the victim" defense.
1911 comment SUSPICION of a crime results n DEATH of the unarmed in the #Black comm as a rule. #MichaelBrown #EricGarner #TrayvonMartin
1912 deny &lt;&lt;he didn't know at all they still has a B.O.L.O out at 7 for the suspect
1913 comment wasn't it just this morning they were saying it was the reason
1914 comment I'm not sure there was a "robbery". Convenience stores keep tobacco behind a counter where you PAY first! IJS #MikeBrown
1915 deny their account is getting worse and worse Roland
1916 comment if u watch the tape, he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
1917 comment you can't tell whether there was somebody behind the counter or not. Either way not related to shooting.
1918 comment I hear ya, but u said the swishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie
1919 query they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he "prime suspect" just minutes after?
1920 support when that didn't made logical sense, now it was jaywalking? And he felt the nd to use deadly force for jaywalking? Lol
1921 deny Well, yeah. He had to trash the name of a dead child before providing that little tid bit.
1922 deny ok so that was mike in the convenience store?
1923 comment that's big
1924 comment Mike thought the coppers were on to him so he tried to assault the officer to get away. #shame..
1925 comment #HandsUpDontShoot hashtavists still don't know his hands were up.
1926 support This, and their militaristic approach to the problem, does not paint the Fergie PD in a favorable light
1927 deny This point is irrelevant. What is important is what happened after the officer contacted the suspect.
1928 deny I believe the robbery actually did happen and is not alleged.
1929 support So he thought he will pick on this black kid because it was a slow day?
1930 comment no justification needed...
1931 comment I asked the guy at the airport. Why did you chose me for a search? He said it was random. I did not buy that.
1932 query nothing is random where the West is concerned...
1933 comment ‚Äú #Ferguson police: Officer involved in fatal shooting of Michael Brown didn't know he was suspect. ridicüò†
1934 comment Hi, like, please)
1935 comment and Brown wasn't aware that the cop was unaware of the violent robbery Brown had just committed.
1936 comment I am sure Cops go to work thinking what black kid can I shoot today and cause riots and Al Sharpton to speak again ..SMH
1937 comment NOTE TO SELF: Actions of committing amy crime, no matter how misqal may justify my death to some, regardless to how unwarranted.
1938 support How is robbery define by state law? Where are the reports from the shooting? Why no ambulance? #ferguson #foi
1939 deny i don't believe that is what he said. He said the stop was initially not about that. Previously, they said he knew of robbery and...
1940 deny had a description.
1941 comment Go Back To Sleep Loraine!!!
1942 query You thought of that all by yourself??? Amazingly Irrelevant!!!
1943 deny Awful! The DOJ needs to do thorough investigation of this PD-these problems are systemic. The citizens deserve better!
1944 support ‚Äú Report: #Ferguson police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009
1945 query Wow. I thought a Tweep was being sarcastic, but...it really happened that way?!?
1946 comment Those times when you laugh at a funny, sarcastic, and ridiculous tweet and then realize it was neither of those...
1947 comment Oh no,That's for real!! The #Pig #MiKeWhite #Ferguson PD!!
1948 comment Just plain scary.
1949 comment Wouldn't you have thought after widely publicized abuses by LAPD and CPD, that departments everywhere else would learn??
1950 comment For that reason precisely, media should refrain from connecting the two. Stay with the shooting story.
1951 comment that's unfortunate. signed, ferguson PD
1952 query It's a strategy to manipulate media and misinform people.
1953 comment you know the cop didnt have to know about robbery for this video to have value. you're not very good at being stupid.
1954 comment it's about changing the narrative.
1955 query Lisa is he the confirmed robber?
1956 support #Ferguson Chief needs to be removed from his job...I never meant 4 this 2 happen..don't insult our intelligence
1957 deny Polluting potential jurors by any Chief of LEOs should be an intentional malice reprimand,+ the county DA may be his Advisor
1958 comment And it is down right disrespectful to the young man and his family.
1959 comment #MikeBrown connects the robbery w shooting. dont have to be a genius. a guy who shoves clerk is s'posed to raise his hands later?
1960 comment stranger by the second
1961 comment Have to show Mike without clean hands somehow.
1962 comment #IMMOALCONSCIOUSNESS
1963 query Shoving a clerk means you'll take on a police officer with a gun? #SoundLogic #YesThisIsSarcasm #MikeBrown
1964 comment I want to believe its total incompetence. But its was all on purpose to change public opinion. My guess is it will continue
1965 support that's what I thought too...
1966 query did of release the report filed by Wilson?
1967 comment he didn't say he didn't know about the robbery, it went out over radio, he said he didn't know #MikeBrown was a suspect
1968 comment it prevented future crimes by #MikeBrown
1969 deny but mike brown knew about the robbery and DIDN'T know the cop didn't know - that's what makes it POSSIBLY relevant
1970 comment The people responsible for killing #MikeBrown should not be in control of the evidence proving what happenend.
1971 query Did the media ask for the video under FOIA as the Chief of Police said? And why was video released without commentary in am?
1972 comment not necessarily. but it might show a particular disposition towards authority figures.
1973 comment Of course he did. It gave people time to solidify the opinions that they already had. It was a calculated move.
1974 support the chief said this am that cop was at a call for sick person, then got the call for store strong arm robbery
1975 support Incorrect. Was on sick person call &amp; then driving came across Brown &amp; friend walking &amp; asked they get off the road
1976 comment i relistened to the press conf &amp; ur right i was wrong
1977 support seems like theres soo much about this case it gets confusing yet there isnt enough info??
1978 comment It's like the 'connect the dots' books. If they sold cliff notes, they'd be outdated by day end. Bumbling idiots
1979 query But she's very good at instigating and baiting....just like her mother. Smh
1980 query and who would blame them when those authority figures are gunning surrendering suspects down?
1981 support I rolled through a stop sign once, the cop was shouting at me like I killed someone. I was terrified. They #overreact.
1982 comment i had no idea that was her mom.
1983 comment since the 'witness' version is incomplete/inaccurate the whole 'hands up' part prob isn't true either #Ferguson
1984 comment sad that happened to you. no doubt there are racist/ignorant cops. but not all, maybe not #Ferguson
1985 query Yep!! Splitting image in everything except one has black hair and other blonde....
1986 comment no doubt scared for his life. It's obviously mike brown in the video
1987 comment Somebody else probably did commit theft. Brown committed Robbery.
1988 comment Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot?
1989 comment dude even his parents acknowledge it's him.
1990 query Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
1991 query Is that the video also?
1992 query And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter?
1993 comment actually I did use the word robbery
1994 comment he seemed frightened
1995 comment possibly. He seemed frightened
1996 query even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft?
1997 comment Your post states theft. What am I missing?
1998 query or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place?
1999 comment Dorian Johnson just confirmed it was them. What now? #blackdenial
2000 comment or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior?
2001 comment I def did not say that. And even if it was #mikesmith I certainly don't think he deserved to die for it.
2002 comment you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change
2003 comment im not saying you did, but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation
2004 comment that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said
2005 comment but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him
2006 comment and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends
2007 comment but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him
2008 comment Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him)
2009 deny Not by this kid.
2010 support you seem to be the only one and that is a testament to your character miss.
2011 comment There are lots of us out there. Promise.
2012 comment Brown's family attorney said in an interview today that the person in the video "probably is Brown"
2013 comment we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice.
2014 support Truer words have never been spoken.
2015 comment it's obviously the same people and there's a confession
2016 comment when I spoke to store owner, I said "robbery", tweeted "theft" in error
2017 comment Hey everybody, robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down?
2018 query whose mike smith ?
2019 query Thank you for clarifying. You definitely didn't have to reply to me. \n\nHave a great day and thanks for the reports
2020 query I'm not arguing that he deserved to be shot.
2021 comment And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
2022 comment Then what are you arguing?
2023 query So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol
2024 comment snitches get stitches in the hood. Store owner knows. #blackdenial #changeyourculture
2025 comment dude give it up. It's him. Confirmed.
2026 comment looooool. "snitches get stiches in the hood" (noracist bro)
2027 comment You get the last word here, I can't argue with everyone forever. Peace.
2028 comment Very embarrassing! Of course I meant #mikebrown. Ugh
2029 comment But Dorian Johnson already admitted they were in store and stole
2030 comment This is getting stranger by the minute. Will we ever get to the truth?
2031 query Where's  With this breaking news? Police Chief making press conference. #SmokeScreen4Murder #Ferguson
2032 comment Y'all --&gt; " Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown said it was someone else"
2033 comment " Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else"
2034 support I could tell it wasn't him when I saw the video.
2035 query why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an explanation
2036 comment now we now why!! Jeez!!
2037 comment think he was too scare to tell who it really was? How many 6'5" 300 # men in Ferguson ?
2038 support Makes them look inept as well.
2039 comment I would rather be a #robber than being a #ColdBloodedMurderer #JusticeForMikeBrown Nowüò°
2040 comment Since they want to label #MikeBrown as a shoplifter, since when is that crime punishable by DEATH?
2041 comment I bet if Michael Brown had his druthers, he‚Äôd rather have his name dragged thru the mud than his life snuffed out.
2042 support SAY IT AGAIN!!!! oh nevermind, I can just it ;-)
2043 comment damn surveillance video We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud.
2044 comment People may not like it. but it's devastating for prosecuting the cop. If true, can be argued Brown thought the cop was after him .
2045 comment Prosecution screwed up the Martin/Zimmerman case by over-charging and if emotions guide, over charging will let this cop walk too.
2046 comment The first goal is to get a conviction so he can never be a cop again.
2047 comment Not sure 'shoot first &amp; uncover potential crime later' is viable policy outside the fevered mind of a conservative
2048 comment AMEN to that!! They would say "LOOK! HE PUSHED THAT STORE CLERK!!.. is that punishable by DEATH?
2049 comment Early reports said the store had not reported a robbery?? The people in the store don't look alarmed.
2050 comment From what I saw it was nothing but a petty theft. Let the Wing tell it, he went in with a GLOCK
2051 comment The point is, the cop didn't know about a robbery. He executed a jaywalker resisting being detained
2052 comment EXACTLY!! Since when is jaywalking punishable by DEATH?
2053 support can find him either under a white cone hat or a koch bed!
2054 comment know surprise there.
2055 support probably the best idea
2056 deny What's that they say? "If he's not guilty, then why did he run?!"
2057 comment I understand his reluctance have his family around the violence, but they should know where he went.
2058 comment

2063 deny and you're basing your assessment on what? Her statement seems to match other witnesses.
2064 comment #nerdland #mediabuzz \n#ANHQDC
2065 support ( :'Darren Wilson, #FergusonMO. (cop) who shot #MikeBrown reportedly skipped town with his family days ago.'
2066 comment :Plausible that the #FergusonPD aided+abetted Wilson in fleeing. PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS for cops should be mandatory.
2067 deny :Please take no offense to my analogy. #FergusonShooting is like something from 'Deliverance.
2324 deny Reports of gunshots unconfirmed  Only photo I will tweet. CPR being performed on the soldier #ottawa
2325 comment thank you for posting. It may just be hard to tell in the picture but bystanders look quite calm considering gunfire in area.

2329 comment I would like to be paid for it, on account of being a journalist.
2330 query why are there no police ??
2331 comment I was there before the police were
2332 comment so.. Instead of helping you took a picture for profit?
2333 comment yeah posting information about an evolving shooter situation is less worthwhile than an untrained journalist performing CPR
2334 deny Fuck you idiot
2335 comment don't have to give cpr. Other ways to help. But yeah keep looking for profit. Great professionalism.
2336 comment stay safe. Hope you're never in the same situation.

2343 query could you email me please to subeditors and I'll explain better, thx
2344 support well said
2345 comment "professional, adjective: engaged in a specified activity as one's main paid occupation rather than as a pastime"
2346 comment so yeah, expecting to get paid for doing his job seems pretty professional to me
2347 deny photography is his job? My whole issue was a man needed help. There are ways to help if you don't know cpr
2348 comment I didn't realize you were on the scene and could verify that he could have saved the life of the guy shot four times.
2349 query Getting the word out about an active shooter situation seems pretty helpful, but please, tell us what you'd have done.
2350 comment Call 911? Signal for help? Keep an eye out for the rescuers? Simply ask the people if there's anything he can do?
2351 deny we won't agree on this and that's okay. If you're in Ottawa stay safe.
2352 comment You don't have any evidence that he didn't do any of these things in addition to taking a picture, but you accuse away.
2353 comment Way to care for people.
2354 comment I agree Tyler, have some respect.That man shot is servicing your country and all you want to do is snap a pic.Pity you!
2355 comment do you think I shouldn't have used social media to warn people? What should I have done?
2356 deny I have no issue with warning people whatsoever. But to take a photo, please!
2357 deny the photo does not show the soldier. It shows the response. Brave bystanders trying to save him
2358 comment You have a phone! Did you call for help? Nope. I took pics to sell and tweeted that I'm on CNN and ABC.
2359 comment my main issue was the picture. Heard your reporting on cnn thought you did a good job. Continue to be safe.

2519 support why shouldn't a private citizen make a comment on a news event?
2520 comment I try‚Ä¶. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd protect me against bullets

2531 comment I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
2532 deny maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
2533 support exactly, because they are "journalists" and "dems the rules" Kelly is a "comedic writer" no rules. Go police journalists
2534 support THANK YOU.
2535 support Perhaps all of Twitter should follow HDM so we can learn the proper ways of Tweeting responsibly.
2536 comment No, you're right. We should follow comedic writers and trust their sources. That's my first instinct.
2537 support seeing as though I was 100% correct, yes.

3765 comment reports around the world flooding in of your 400% fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart.
3766 comment Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission
3767 comment nope. I respect them for making the rides free, I can also see how they wanted to get more drivers in
3768 comment initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. Much better.
3769 comment so our GOVERNMENT is making money from people trying to get out of a hostage situation but you don't shout and yell at them...
3770 support but you do Uber for trying to increase drivers. My work here is done your honour.

3777 comment the surge rates are to draw the drivers there (uber will pay the cost). No fee to passengers.
3778 comment Ah that makes sense then thanks
3779 comment didn't make it very clear in the beginning.
3780 comment no idea what you mean?
3781 comment Taxis all offer $30 discount to disabled passengers, #uber doesnt even have disabled taxis to offer. That's true PT

3783 comment don't know if your being sarcastic or going of topic
3784 comment You called uber public transport, it's not. PT is for everyone not just the elite.
3785 comment The rides are free. will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket.
3786 deny I never called uber PT. Everyone is having a go at Uber but not PT... We own it,we shouldn't have to pay in desperate times
3787 comment I'm baffled by how few of its customers actually know how Uber works.
3788 support for the transport service I don't run? Excellent point sir. If they wanted to save money, they should've kept quiet.

3794 comment Same people pro do sweet all but moan on social media about how terrible everyone else is.. And yes irony burning my end.
3795 comment I see your point. Maybe should make transport free from the CBD today.
3796 comment That is the point, dummy. Lots of drivers signing up for Uber. They are smarter than you. So help out and shut it
