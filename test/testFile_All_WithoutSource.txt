2118 query @flightradar24 any idea why it'd flight so high?  It's a short flight, usually planes go at ~ 33,000 feet
2119 query @flightradar24 But no emergency call made? Or emergency squawk? @isobelroe
2120 comment RT @flightradar24 #A320 #4U9525 initially climbed to 38k ft before starting to descend and lost signal at 6.8k ft http://t.co/LUWkDrBR9a
2121 comment @flightradar24 Sounds like a decent of 2900fpm
2122 query @flightradar24 Any ATC available? Strange.....
2123 query @flightradar24 isn‚Äôt 38,000ft unusually high?
2124 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk
2125 comment @janoschjerman @flightradar24 yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker
2126 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Only takes a second to set the squawk code,
2127 query @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe What's the use when you're crashing?
2128 comment @Minus777 @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone.....
2129 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now.
2130 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Unless they became rapidly unconcious
2131 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground.
2132 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Anyway. Have to wait and see now.
2133 comment @Minus777 @marcepa49 @isobelroe For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before https://t.co/JoVKD5OHC0
2134 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that.
2135 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant.
2136 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside..
2137 comment @flightradar24 @Minus777 @marcepa49 @isobelroe Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.
2138 comment @flightradar24 @marcepa49 @isobelroe What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground
2139 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down.
2140 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set.
2141 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe I don't think the autopilot was engaged.
2142 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane.
2143 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe That's what they say.
2144 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe The data from the transponder made it obvious.
2145 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though.
2146 deny @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700.
2147 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no
2148 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did
2149 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up.
2150 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe It only takes a moment to enter 7700 into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before.
2151 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says)
2152 support @marcepa49 The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up.
2153 comment @marcepa49 Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made
2154 comment @marcepa49 the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them
2155 comment @marcepa49 @flightradar24 @isobelroe and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck.
2156 comment @Minus777 @flightradar24 @isobelroe Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved.
2157 comment @marcepa49 But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged.
2158 comment @Minus777 what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged?
2159 comment @marcepa49 It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.
2160 comment @UlrichJvV Lets wait for NTSB to tell us why it happened. I hope its not terrorism.

2170 query @thatjohn what are the implications of this? @RAeSTimR
2171 comment @thatjohn @RunwayGirl They made that call in French?
2172 comment @thatjohn @Holbornlolz Mayday is a call for urgent assistance. (M'aidez). Not a lot of help for a plane hurtling towards the floor.
2173 query @thatjohn @planefinder why would they say urgence in lieu of mayday which is standard ?
2174 comment @thatjohn @gerrylynch mayday is French!
2175 comment @cobaltjacket @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Lots of radio protocol is French... Mayday is M'aidez. Urgence, pan-pan, "see-lonce" etc.
2176 comment @Fedupwithclowns @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Roger. Just seems odd given most comms are in English. Doesn't make it wrong, of course.
2177 query @thatjohn is that unusual?
2178 comment @cobaltjacket @thatjohn @RunwayGirl Just historic. Also hard to confuse with other words, so clear for the listener.
2179 support @thatjohn @RAeSTimR Is that roughly equivalent to our 'Pan Pan' call it priority I assume?
2180 comment @1CParsons @thatjohn No 'Pan Pan' call is universal
2181 comment @RAeSTimR @thatjohn Ahh.. I was always taught it was a UK only thing; and having done only limited flying abroad never tested that!
2182 comment @AirSmolik Only entered FL380 for a few mins prior too. So sad.
2183 comment @AirSmolik but at a controlled speed (unless readings were out), which makes it even more bizarre. I hope they find the real answers soon
