2118 query any idea why it'd flight so high? It's a short flight, usually planes go at ~ 33,000 feet Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2119 query But no emergency call made? Or emergency squawk? Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.

2123 query isn’t 38,000ft unusually high? Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2124 comment Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2125 comment yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were 25 mins late so going higher = going quicker Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.

2128 comment yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone..... Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2129 comment It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2130 comment Unless they became rapidly unconcious Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2131 comment It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2132 comment Anyway. Have to wait and see now. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2133 comment For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2134 comment No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2135 comment If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2136 comment which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside.. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2137 comment Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2138 comment What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2139 comment They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2140 comment Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2141 comment I don't think the autopilot was engaged. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2142 comment They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2143 comment That's what they say. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2144 comment The data from the transponder made it obvious. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2145 comment Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2146 deny The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak 7700. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2147 comment It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2148 comment distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2149 comment crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2150 comment It only takes a moment to enter 7700 into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2151 comment Autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (Flightradar24 says) Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2152 support The autopilot wasn't set to 100 feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2153 comment Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2154 comment the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to 100 feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2155 comment and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2156 comment Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2157 comment But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2158 comment what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged? Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.
2159 comment It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection. Flight #4U9525 initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet.

2170 query what are the implications of this? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2171 comment They made that call in French? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2172 comment Mayday is a call for urgent assistance. (M'aidez). Not a lot of help for a plane hurtling towards the floor. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2173 query why would they say urgence in lieu of mayday which is standard ? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2174 comment mayday is French! 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2175 comment Lots of radio protocol is French... Mayday is M'aidez. Urgence, pan-pan, "see-lonce" etc. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2176 comment Roger. Just seems odd given most comms are in English. Doesn't make it wrong, of course. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2177 query is that unusual? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2178 comment Just historic. Also hard to confuse with other words, so clear for the listener. 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2179 support Is that roughly equivalent to our 'Pan Pan' call it priority I assume? 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2180 comment No 'Pan Pan' call is universal 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2181 comment Ahh.. I was always taught it was a UK only thing; and having done only limited flying abroad never tested that! 1047 call: DGAC source says pilots called «urgence, urgence» (“emergency, emergency”), as opposed to a mayday call or 7700 squawk. #4U9525
2182 comment Only entered FL380 for a few mins prior too. So sad. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?

2189 support my thoughts exactly. rate is not unusual but surely crew were aware of where they were &amp; terrain... this'll be interesting. #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
2190 comment EMERG DESC, set FL68, started descent and lost consciousness before able to set higher ALT? Seems likely... #4U9525 From FL380 to FL110 in 8 min? That's average rate of descent 3375 fpm! Than levelled off at FL068? What the hell was going on there?
